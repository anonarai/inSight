Re-imagining the White Cane for Visually Impaired Individuals through Technology

The Problem:

Target Audience: Visually impaired individuals
A small portion of Individuals who are visually impaired use the white cane
The cane affects the behaviors of others
if they offer to help, sympathy, etc.
Current devices/tools employed by the visually impaired include: guide dogs, friends/family, etc.
Those visually impaired are unable to interact with screen based technology
Solution:

A device/tool/service to assist visually impaired individuals
A kinetic proximity sensor to detect how close an object is from a subject
Utilizing a threshold to determine if the proximity is under a particular depth, if so, we alarm the user through a series of vibrations.
Vibrations would be emitted through a smart watch or telephone.
Technical Difficulties

All team members are beginners at coding
Kinect is a relatively new device, so not much information is readily available
Languages we used: JavaScript and C#
No Athenahack mentors had experience with Kinect, only one Microsoft individual was fluent in Kinect.
No Athenahack mentors had experience with programming Pebble Smartwatch Applications -- this led us to pivot towards notifying the user their proximity to an object through vibrations through mobile phones.
Accomplishments that we're proud of

Creating a successful prototype to demonstrate our project
Not giving up!
Overcoming obstacles (time constraints, knowledge, resources, etc)
Pivoting, and being open minded to new ideas and ways to improve our product.
What we learned

Hackathons are cool!
Kinetic, and how to program in C# with it
C#, C++, JavaScript, Twilio, Express, and node.js
How to pitch our product to judges
How to create a server
How to send text messages from a server
Working with like-minded individuals
Collaboration, Creativity,
What's next for inSight

We hope to use the technology we've created to then condense the Kinect into a smaller device and turn it into a wearable.
The technology employed in inSight can be used in other aspects such as Security.
